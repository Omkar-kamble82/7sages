<h1>7sages Website</h1>
<p>My three-month internship at 7 SAGES Solutions LLP resulted in the development of the landing page website project. I was able to learn how to work for a client as I was hired for this web internship because of my frontend skills. Through my internship, I gained experience working in a professional setting and learning how to guarantee the release of a bug-free product. This was my first real-world experience, and I was fortunate to have an excellent manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/srinivasan-m-s-b179b617/">Mr.M S Srininivasan (Founder | CEO of 7sages)</a>, who helped me throughout the project.
